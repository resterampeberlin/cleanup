# Purpose

This script clean files produced by Apple iCLoud synchronisation. Those have usually the name `file 2`, `.file 2`, or `file 2.icloud`. The original filenames are "`file` or `.file`.

The script find those files, checks if a original file is present in the same directory and deletes or simply shows the filenames. 
The script searches in a given subdirectory and all its subfolders.

# Command line options

## Help (-h, --help)

Show a help text

## Dry run (--dry-run)

Show only the duplicate files. The script does not delete any file. 
The default is to show duplicate files.

## Force (--force)

Usually the script asks before deleting a file. With `--force` the file is deleted immediately. 
The default is to aks before deleting.

`--dry-run` and `--force`are mutually exclusice.

## DonÂ´t show valid file (--no-valid)

You may have valid files named `file 2`. Usually the script show those when there is **no** `file` in the same directory. Use `--no-valid` to suppress this message.
